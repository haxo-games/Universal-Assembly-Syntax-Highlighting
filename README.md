# VS Code x86/x64 Assembly Syntax Highlighting Extension

## Overview

This Visual Studio Code extension provides comprehensive syntax highlighting for x86 and x64 assembly language using Intel syntax. It's designed to improve readability and understanding of assembly code, including compiler-generated output.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for x86 and x64 assembly instructions
- Support for Intel syntax
- Highlighting of registers, memory operands, and numeric constants
- Recognition of common assembler directives
- Proper highlighting of labels and function names
- Support for compiler-generated assembly features (e.g., CFI directives)

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for "x86/x64 Assembly Syntax Highlighting"
4. Click Install

Alternatively, you can download the VSIX file from the releases page and install it manually:

1. Download the `.vsix` file
2. In VS Code, go to the Extensions view
3. Click on the "..." at the top of the Extensions view
4. Choose "Install from VSIX..." and select the downloaded file

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically provide syntax highlighting for files with the following extensions:

- `.asm`
- `.s`
- `.S`
- `.nasm`

If you're working with a file that has a different extension but contains x86/x64 assembly code, you can manually set the language mode:

1. Click on the language indicator in the bottom-right corner of VS Code
2. Select "x86/x64 Assembly" from the list of languages

## Highlighted Elements

This extension provides syntax highlighting for:

- Instructions (e.g., `mov`, `push`, `call`)
- Registers (e.g., `eax`, `rbp`, `r15`)
- Memory operands (e.g., `DWORD PTR`, `QWORD PTR`)
- Numeric constants (decimal and hexadecimal)
- Labels and function names
- Assembler directives (e.g., `.section`, `.global`)
- CFI directives (e.g., `.cfi_startproc`, `.cfi_endproc`)
- Comments (lines starting with `;`)

## Customization

You can customize the colors used for syntax highlighting by modifying your VS Code color theme. Add or modify entries in your `settings.json` file under `"editor.tokenColorCustomizations"`.

For example:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        {
            "scope": "keyword.control.instruction.x86asm",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#C678DD"
            }
        },
        {
            "scope": "variable.language.register.x86asm",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#E06C75"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
